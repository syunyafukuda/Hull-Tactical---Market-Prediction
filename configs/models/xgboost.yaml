# XGBoost Model Configuration
# This configuration defines the default hyperparameters for XGBoost model training.
# Based on the LGBM baseline with parameters adapted for XGBoost's tree-based approach.

xgboost:
  # Model objective and tree construction
  objective: "reg:squarederror"
  tree_method: "hist"  # histogram-based algorithm for faster training
  
  # Tree structure parameters
  max_depth: 6  # Maximum depth of a tree (LGBM equivalent control)
  min_child_weight: 32  # Minimum sum of instance weight (corresponds to LGBM's min_data_in_leaf)
  
  # Learning parameters
  learning_rate: 0.05  # Step size shrinkage (eta)
  n_estimators: 600  # Number of boosting rounds
  
  # Sampling parameters
  subsample: 0.8  # Subsample ratio of training instances (bagging_fraction in LGBM)
  colsample_bytree: 0.8  # Subsample ratio of columns when constructing each tree (feature_fraction in LGBM)
  
  # Regularization
  reg_alpha: 0.0  # L1 regularization term on weights
  reg_lambda: 1.0  # L2 regularization term on weights
  
  # System parameters
  random_state: 42
  n_jobs: -1  # Use all CPU cores
  verbosity: 0  # Silent mode
  
  # Early stopping (applied in training script)
  early_stopping_rounds: 50

# Feature selection configuration
feature_selection:
  tier: "tier3"  # Use FS_compact (116 features)
  excluded_json: "configs/feature_selection/tier3/excluded.json"

# Cross-validation settings
cv:
  n_splits: 5
  gap: 0  # No gap between train and validation
  min_val_size: 0

# Data paths
data:
  data_dir: "data/raw"
  train_file: null  # Auto-detect
  test_file: null  # Auto-detect

# Output configuration
output:
  artifacts_dir: "artifacts/models/xgboost"
  save_artifacts: true

# Success criteria
success_criteria:
  oof_rmse_threshold: 0.0125  # Baseline (0.01216) + 3%
  correlation_vs_lgbm_max: 0.98  # Ensure diversity for ensembling
