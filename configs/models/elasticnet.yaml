# ElasticNet Model Configuration
# This configuration defines the default hyperparameters for ElasticNet model training.
# ElasticNet combines L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization for hybrid linear modeling.

elasticnet:
  # Regularization parameters
  alpha: 0.001  # Overall regularization strength (higher = more regularization)
  l1_ratio: 0.5  # Mix of L1 and L2 (0=Ridge only, 1=Lasso only, 0.5=equal mix)
  
  # Model parameters
  fit_intercept: true  # Whether to calculate intercept for model
  max_iter: 10000  # Maximum number of iterations for optimization
  tol: 0.0001  # Tolerance for optimization convergence
  selection: "cyclic"  # Method for coefficient updates: "cyclic" or "random"
  random_state: 42
  
  # Note: StandardScaler is applied in the pipeline (required for linear models)

# Feature selection configuration
feature_selection:
  tier: "tier3"  # Use FS_compact (116 features)
  excluded_json: "configs/feature_selection/tier3/excluded.json"

# Cross-validation settings
cv:
  n_splits: 5
  gap: 0  # No gap between train and validation
  min_val_size: 0

# Data paths
data:
  data_dir: "data/raw"
  train_file: null  # Auto-detect
  test_file: null  # Auto-detect

# Output configuration
output:
  artifacts_dir: "artifacts/models/elasticnet"
  save_artifacts: true
  save_coefficients: true  # Save non-zero coefficients to coefficients.csv

# Success criteria
success_criteria:
  oof_rmse_threshold: 0.0125  # Baseline (0.01216) + 3%
  correlation_vs_lgbm_max: 0.98  # Ensure diversity for ensembling
