# ExtraTrees Model Configuration
# This configuration defines the default hyperparameters for ExtraTrees model training.
# ExtraTrees (Extremely Randomized Trees) provides model diversity for ensemble methods.

extratrees:
  # Tree structure parameters
  n_estimators: 500  # Number of trees in the forest (higher = more stable predictions)
  max_depth: 15  # Maximum depth of each tree
  min_samples_split: 10  # Minimum samples required to split an internal node
  min_samples_leaf: 5  # Minimum samples required to be at a leaf node
  
  # Feature sampling
  max_features: 0.7  # Proportion of features to consider for each split (70%)
  
  # Sampling strategy
  bootstrap: false  # ExtraTrees default: use all samples (no bootstrap)
  
  # System parameters
  random_state: 42
  n_jobs: -1  # Use all CPU cores
  verbose: 0  # Silent mode

# Feature selection configuration
feature_selection:
  tier: "tier3"  # Use FS_compact (116 features)
  excluded_json: "configs/feature_selection/tier3/excluded.json"

# Cross-validation settings

  n_splits: 5
  gap: 0  # No gap between train and validation (same as LGBM baseline)
  min_val_size: 0

# Data paths

  purpose: "Provide bagging-based model diversity (vs gradient boosting)"
  expected_characteristics:
    - "Extremely randomized split points (faster than RandomForest)"
    - "Lower overfitting risk due to high randomization"
    - "Different prediction errors compared to LGBM/XGBoost"
    - "High ensemble value due to decorrelated predictions"
  model_characteristics:
    scaling_required: false  # Tree-based model
    handles_missing: false  # Requires imputation
    interpretability: "medium"  # Feature importances available
